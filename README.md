Problem:

17.Badalyan Mikayel
One move deep chess player.
 - Description: There is no control over the allowed moves of pieces.
1. Player program step criteria: 1. maximum material 2. heuristic: attack on the opponent's king.
2. Displaying the result of the heuristic criterion.
3. WPF implementation. Use object-oriented programming concepts.

• Material weights of chess pieces: King 1000; Queen 90; Root 50; Bishop 33; Knight 30; Pown 10. White -
positive values, Black - negative values.
• A rank score is a number that has two components. The whole part of the number and the sum of all the
numbers in the matrix are represented materially. The heuristic criterion forms the fractional part of the
position estimate.
• Chess played with one move depth means one move for white and one move for black.
